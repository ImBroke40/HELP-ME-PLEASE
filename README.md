 what I need help with is when it says
else:
    print("SAHB OS DOES NOT RECOGNIZE ANS")
    time.sleep(2.5)
    sys.exit ()
it doesnt work properly, im on python 3 with IDLE python and what happenes here is that even if i do type in "good or "bad or "okay" it says sahb doesnt recognize and just exits, i want it to continue the code to the game and only when i dont type in good or bad or okay i want it to says sahb doesnt recognize and exit
